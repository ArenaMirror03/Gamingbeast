    <h2>About the Game</h2>
    After the last installment of Grand Theft Auto IV in 2008, this is the next one to be added to the series. Grand Theft Auto V is an action-adventure game that was developed and published by Rockstar North and Rockstar Games respectively. The game belongs to the popular series of Grand Theft Auto and is set in fictional San Andreas.  
The story takes place in the Southern part of California where a retired bank robber, a street gangster, and a drug dealer attempt to commit different heists. These characters are portrayed as under pressure by several powerful criminals and a corrupted government agency. 
This is a game constructed to the concept of an open world, where the player can discover and wander in new places. This single-player game thus lets you roam about in almost all the places you want in the fictional place of San Andreas. You can also check out Los Santos (again a fictional city) and the countryside of San Andreas.
